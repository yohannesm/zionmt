= Introduction =

a program to implement an stack-allocated 2D matrix object.

== bool operator == ==
It tells whether the both matrix is same or not.
== bool operator < ==
It tells whether the rhs matrix's values are larger than lhs matrix's values.
==  operator + ==
Add the some constant value to the each value in the Matrix. Add also each value from rhs Matrix to the lhs Matrix.
== operator - ==
subtract the constant value from the Matrix. subtract each value from rhs Matrix to the lhs Matrix.
== operator * ==
Multiply the constant value to each value in the Matrix.
== operator / ==
Divide each value from the matrix by constant value.
== constructor containing constant value ==
constructor that takes the array containing the constant value.
== constructor containing the pointer ==
constructor that takes the array containing the pointer to the array.
== reference operator [] ==
subscript for the matrix. It returns the pointer pointing to array.
== const_reference operator [] == 
const subscript for the matrix. It returns the pointer pointing to the const array. 
== operator += ==
It works in same way as '+'
== operator -= ==
It works in same way as '-'
== operator *= ==
It works in same way as '*'
== operator /= ==
It works in same way as '/'
== operator %= ==
It works in same way as '%'
== apply ==
applying function into each elements in Matrix.
